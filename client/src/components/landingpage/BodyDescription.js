            Hey, I'm Quinn Melssen, a developer graduating from Northern Arizona
            University with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. This
            website's main purpose is to showcase some of the projects that I
            have worked on over the course of my undergraduate. Currently I am
            job hunting so I can be prepared to enter the industry when I
            graduate in Spring!
        </p>
